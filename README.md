## Project Description

###### Purpose : 
- Explore JPA/Hibernate
- Use Spring Boot Testing
- Implement DAO and DTO classes as appropriate

---

###### Requirements : 
- Develop JPA entities and repositories for all 6 tables in the employees sample database in MySQL:
  - departments
  - dept_emp
  - dept_manager
  - employees
  - salaries
  - titles
- Create DAO and DTO classes to abstract the data access layer
- Add methods to enable the following functionality:
  - Find employees by last name`
  - Find all the employees who worked in a named department on a given date
  - What is the average salary for a named department on a given date?
  - Given a job title name, what is the range of salary values within a given year?
  - Provide a summary of the size of each department (number of staff) over a given period (start year to end year)
  - Is there a gender pay gap? If so, quantify it
- Add 3 methods of your own to investigate similar questions
- Configure a Spring Boot application to host the JPA classes`
- Use Spring Boot Test to create a comprehensive suite for your JPA classes and your DAO/DTO classes
- Include the result of your testing in the README.md file for the project on GitHub
- Include code coverage data for all JPA classes, with explanations for any low coverage levels, in the README.md
